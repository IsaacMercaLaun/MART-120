\f0\fs24 \cf0 After learning and seeing the differences between the GUI (Graphical User Interface) and CLI (Command-Line Interface) I have also noticed hoe similar they are\'85 probably because they\'92re looking at the same thing in a different way. Out of the two interfaces I\'92m definitely more used to the GUI since it\'92s all I\'92ve really known. I feel like I can\'92t really see a reason to use the Command-Line Interface in an everyday setting when the Graphical Interface is just so much more simple and easier to relate real life to. Using CLI would also prove to be difficult for people who are just getting to know their computer, and although you get more the \'93rawness\'94 from looking at and figuring out the CLI I still think that the GUI is better in this day and age. }
