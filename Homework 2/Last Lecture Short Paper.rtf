\f0\fs24 \cf0 After watching the Last Lecture video I feel like the sky isn\'92t the limit anymore. The stories he brought to the table about his life and his many accomplishments all felt so surreal in the fact that he was so genuine and so \'91in the moment\'92. While he was up on that stage in felt like everything he had done in his life and all the serious life lessons he\'92d learned were all coming together into one insurmountable feeling of pure gratitude that he had for the way was able to be raised and the way he worked and he was so thankful for the amazing people he had met in his life. He had so many good saying and teachings for anyone who is trying to figure out how they do things. I found a lot of significance in a fraise he said, \'93When you\'92re doing something wrong and no one is willing to tell you why you\'92re wrong and how to fix it, you\'92re in a very bad place.\'94 This quote kinda stuck with me because I know that there were definitely some points in my life where someone cared about me enough to tell me I\'92m wrong and then helped me go down the right path.\
	I think Randy is an incredibly inspiring person and I\'92m very glad I watched it all the way through.}
