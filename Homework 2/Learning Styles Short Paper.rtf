\f0\fs24 \cf0 As someone with ADHD I would say that learning styles are definitely a key factor in how we all learn put they aren\'92t the root of the problem as far as academics go. I struggle so much with school work and how I learn and perceive new information and after the struggle I\'92ve been able to kind of self reflect and figure out what works for me and what doesn\'92t. While certain learning styles have helped me in my academic career I also want to give most of the credit of the problem to plain old laziness. At the end of the day it really comes down to how bad you want something and if you have the strength to keep going when you think can\'92t.}
